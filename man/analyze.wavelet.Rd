\title{
Computation of the wavelet power spectrum of a single time series
}

\description{
The time series is selected from an input data frame by specifying
either its name or its column number. Optionally, the time series
is detrended, using \code{loess} with parameter \code{loess.span}.
Internally, the series will be further standardized before it
undergoes wavelet transformation.

The wavelet power spectrum is computed by applying the Morlet
wavelet. P-values to test the null hypothesis that a period (within lowerPeriod and upperPeriod) is irrelevant at a certain time
are calculated if desired; this is accomplished with the help of a
simulation algorithm. There is a selection of models from which to
choose the alternative hypothesis. The selected model will be fitted to
the data and simulated according to estimated parameters in order
to provide surrogate time series.

Wavelet transformation, as well as p-value computations, are
carried out by calling subroutine \code{wt}.

The name and parts of the layout of subroutine \code{wt} were inspired by a similar function developed by 
Huidong Tian and Bernard Cazelles (archived R package \code{WaveletCo}). The basic concept of the simulation algorithm, and of ridge determination build on ideas developed by these authors. The major part of the code for the computation of the cone of influence, and the code for Fourier-randomized surrogate time series
has been adopted from Huidong Tian. 

Wavelet computation, the simulation algorithm, and ridge determination build heavily on the use of matrices in order to minimize computation time in R. 

This function provides a broad variety of final as well as intermediate results 
which can be further analyzed in detail.

## The following example is adopted from Liu et al, 2007:

series.length = 6*128*24
x1 = periodic.series(start.period = 1*24, length = series.length)
x2 = periodic.series(start.period = 8*24, length = series.length)
x3 = periodic.series(start.period = 32*24, length = series.length)
x4 = periodic.series(start.period = 128*24, length = series.length)
x = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4

plot(ts(x, start=0, frequency=24), type="l", 
  xlab="time (days)", 
  ylab="hourly data", main="a series of hourly data with periods of 1, 8, 32, and 128 days")
     
my.data = data.frame(x=x)

my.wt = analyze.wavelet(my.data, "x", 
                        loess.span=0, 
                        dt=1/24, dj=1/20, 
                        lowerPeriod=1/4, 
                        make.pval=T, n.sim=10)
